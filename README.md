# Employee_Database_challenge

##Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project is to identify the number of retiring employees and thier titles as well as find who is elegible to participate in a mentorship program.

##Results:
- over 72000 employees will be retiring soon
- nearly 51000 of them are senior staff or senior engineers
- the current parameters only designate 1549 employees as eligible for the mentorship program.
- In order to make up the difference in the number of people retiring and those that are eligible to mentor, the age constraints on mentors should be adjusted.

##Summary:
Over the next few years there are a large number of employees who will be leaving the company as part of the “silver tsunami”. At the moment the constraints for who could be in the mentorship program look as though they will be far to small. Other things to consider may be a breakdown of the expected retirees by year and a refinement of the retiring_titles by year.
